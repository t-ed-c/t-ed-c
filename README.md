- 👋 Hi, I’m @t-ed-c
- 👀 I’m interested in technology, cryptography, Python, digital systems, and African philosophy.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning counters, combinational logic circuits, cryptography, and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on  cryptography projects or Python-related tech developments.
- 📫 How to reach me 
- 😄 Pronouns:byte/bitself (Byte’s passionate about Python and bitself is diving into cryptography.)
- ⚡ Fun fact:  I can talk about combinational logic and cryptography, but I’m still trying to figure out how my coffee machine works in the morning!
